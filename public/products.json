        "question": "What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?",
        "answer": "There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:(1)Local (UI) state Local state is data we manage in one or another component.Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.(2)Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components.Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.(3)Server state – Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.(4)URL state – Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters."
